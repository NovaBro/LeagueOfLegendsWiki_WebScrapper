# LeagueOfLegendsWiki_WebScrapper
Python program that gets the stats of all League of Legends champions from scrapping the wiki!
You first select which champions you want stats on, then select what stat exactely you want to graph and compare to other champions,
and then hit graph. The initial fetch for each new champion may be slow FYI. The driver file is the GUI.py.
